<h1>Impact of Covid-19 on people's health and their livelihoods</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<hr style="width:30%;text-align:left;margin-left:0">
<p>While a global pandemic has been a looming risk for decades, COVID-19 has taken the entire world by a storm. It has come as a shock to society, health systems, economies, and governments worldwide.</br> Nearly half of the world’s 3.3 billion global workforce are at risk of losing their livelihoods. Informal economy workers are particularly vulnerable because the majority lack social protection and access to quality health care and have lost access to productive assets. Without the means to earn an income during lockdowns, many are unable to feed themselves and their families. For most, no income means no food, or, at best, less food and less nutritious food. Millions of people lost their jobs globally. All these factors have led to deterioration of mental health in many human beings.Throughout the pandemic, anxiety, depression, sleep disruptions, and thoughts of suicide have increased for many young adults due to loss of employment or income, closure of universities, transitioning to remote work etc.</p>

<h3> Why is mental health important?</h3>
<p>Mental health is important because it can help you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cope with the stresses of life.</li>
<li>Have good relationships.</li>
<li>Make meaningful contributions to your community.</li
<li>Work productively</li>
<li>Realize your full potential.</li></ul>

<h3>How can I improve my mental health?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Staying positive:</strong>It's important to try to have a positive outlook</li>
<ul><li>Finding balance between positive and negative emotions.</li>
<li>Taking a break from negative information. Know when to stop watching or reading the news. Use social media to reach out for support and feel connected to others but be careful. Don't fall for rumors, get into arguments, or negatively compare your life to others</li>
<li>Practicing gratitude, which means being thankful for the good things in your life. It's helpful to do this every day, either by thinking about what you are grateful for or writing it down in a journal. These can be big things, such as the support you have from loved ones, or little things, such as enjoying a nice meal</li></ul>
<li><strong>Taking care of your physical health,</strong>since your physical and mental health are connected</li>
<ul><li>Being physically active. Exercise can reduce feelings of stress and depression and improve your mood</li>
<li>Getting enough sleep. Sleep affects your mood. If you don't get a good sleep, you may become more easily annoyed and angry</li>
<li>Healthy eating. Good nutrition will help you feel better physically but could also improve your mood and decrease anxiety and stress</li></ul>
<li><strong>Developing coping skills</strong> which are methods you use to deal with stressful situations. They may help you face a problem, take action, be flexible, and not easily give up in solving it.</li>
<li><strong>Meditation</strong>which is a mind and body practice where you learn to focus your attention and awareness. There are many types, including mindfulness meditation and transcendental meditation. Meditation usually involves:
	<ul>
		<li>A quiet location with as few distractions as possible</li>
		<li>A specific, comfortable posture. This could be sitting, lying down, walking, or 		another position.</li>
		<li>A focus of attention, such as a specially chosen word or set of words, an object, 		or your breathing</li>
		<li>An open attitude, where you try to let distractions come and go naturally without 		judging them</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Relaxation techniques</strong>are practices you do to produce your body's natural relaxation response. This slows down your breathing, lowers your blood pressure, and reduces muscle tension and stress. Types of relaxation techniques include:</li>
<ul>
<li>Progressive relaxation, where you tighten and relax different muscle groups, sometimes while using mental imagery or breathing exercises</li>
<li>Self-hypnosis, where the goal is to get yourself into a relaxed, trance-like state when you hear a certain suggestion or see a specific cu</li>
<li>Deep breathing exercises, which involve focusing on taking slow, deep, even breaths</li></ul>
